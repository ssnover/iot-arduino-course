If you've stuck with me this far, you must be interested in the subject matter! 

This page will serve as a living list of links for additional writing I do for content that's related to this course which discusses different aspects of developing embedded systems. If there's a topic you're interested in and you don't see it here, feel free to send me a message!

I will also link to posts or writing that I've seen others produce on the topic of embedded systems so as not to unnecessarily reinvent the wheel on every topic.
